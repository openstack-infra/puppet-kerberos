# Managed by puppet
# Don't set anything here.
# We don't set RUN_KADMIND because newer debuntu packaging
# postinst scripts are broken if RUN_KADMIND is set to false.
# Long story short they try to set a debconf value based on
# that value and there is no associated template with that
# key/question so things break.
#
# Instead we manage whether or not slave nodes run kadmind
# via the init system (via the puppet service resource).
